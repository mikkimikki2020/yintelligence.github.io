<p>UTAS - Understanding Dementia MOOC</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Module 2, The Brain, provides the brain science (or neuroscience) underlying dementia. It starts by looking at some of the complexities of dementia, before explaining the brain changes that lead to dementia. The module explores the structure of the nervous system, including the anatomy (structure) and physiology (function) of the smallest parts of the nervous system, the nerve cells (neurons). It then deals with the pathology or abnormal brain changes that occur in the major diseases that cause dementia, explaining the links between these and the symptoms that develop. It finishes by looking at future directions of research into dementia.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes-the-brain">Learning Outcomes: The Brain</h2>
<p>On successful completion of this module, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe some of the complexities of dementia.</li>
<li>Describe, at a basic level, how the nervous system works.</li>
<li>Describe the basic anatomy of the brain, a neuron and a synapse.</li>
<li>Describe the pathology of the four major diseases that cause dementia, particularly Alzheimer’s disease.</li>
<li>Explain the link between brain pathology and the symptoms of dementia.</li>
<li>Describe some of the key areas of current dementia research.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="complexities-of-dementia">Complexities of Dementia</h2>
<p>Katie and Bryce show how confusing dementia can be...</p>
<p><img src="/images/HMS/image-20210902212240129.png" /></p>
<p>Katie said:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alzheimer's disease is just one of the possible causes of dementia.</li>
<li>Dementia is a <em>syndrome</em> - a collection of symptoms.</li>
<li>There are many diseases and conditions that can lead to dementia; Alzheimer's disease is just one of them, but it is the main cause.</li>
<li>Different diseases can result in different types of dementia, can progress at different rates, and in some cases (but not many) can respond to different treatments.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dementia-is-a-syndrome">Dementia is a syndrome</h3>
<p>We can’t define dementia exactly, and that is indeed part of its complexity.</p>
<p>Dementia isn’t one condition. It’s what we call a syndrome. It’s a collection of signs and symptoms that are caused by a number of diseases; up to some dozen, some say up to a hundred, but certainly dozens of conditions that cause dementia.</p>
<p>So it's a syndrome, a collection of symptoms that people with the condition share.</p>
<h4 id="is-alzheimers-dementia">Is Alzheimer’s dementia?</h4>
<p>Alzheimer’s is one of those dozens of diseases or conditions that cause dementia. It’s indeed the most common cause of dementia, but there are many others.</p>
<p>For example, things like Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, vascular disease, and indeed, Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer’s disease accounts for about 60 to 70% of all the dementias. It’s the most common cause, but it's not the only cause of dementia.</strong></p>
<h3 id="what-sort-of-people-get-dementia">What sort of people get dementia?</h3>
<p>Dementia doesn't discriminate. All sorts of people get dementia, however, it's most commonly associated with <strong>aging</strong>. <u>It’s not a normal part of aging, but it's associated with aging.</u></p>
<p>We estimate 90 to 95% of all the dementias occur in people over the age of 65.</p>
<p>Just to clarify though, of everyone over the age of 65, only about 10% of that entire population have a dementia. But of all the dementias, over 90% occur in people over the age of 65.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine that Mrs G. has a recent diagnosis of dementia and she presents with the following list of symptoms/behaviours.</p>
<p>Mrs G's Symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has started forgetting where the tea bags are kept.</li>
<li>Is having trouble operating her television remote control.</li>
<li>Has started misjudging distances and is finding herself stumbling on steps.</li>
<li>Has started misunderstanding jokes and is taking offence.</li>
</ul>
<p>What could happen if each of these symptoms were to worsen over time?</p>
<p>List some possible symptoms/behaviours that Mrs G. may now display.</p>
<ul>
<li>Earlier in the course of dementia, Mrs G. may forget where the tea bags are kept, but may progress later on to forgetting that she has left the stove on, forgetting where she lives and even forgetting who her friends and family are.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="younger-onset-dementia">Younger-onset dementia</h4>
<p>Somebody can be born with a very rare kind of dementia, and it's not compatible with living very long, that very early kind of dementia.</p>
<p>Younger people can indeed get dementia. Later in the MOOC we look at younger-onset dementia, which is often genetically linked, although not always.</p>
<p>So certainly, people in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, and early 60s can get dementia, have dementia. But they're in the minority of the total population of people with dementia. All walks of life, both genders are particularly congregated in those individuals over the age of 65. As people age beyond 65, their likelihood of getting dementia increases, so to the point we think that around 50% of people over the age of 95 are likely to have dementia.</p>
<h4 id="no-specific-racial-linkage">No specific racial linkage</h4>
<p>There’s not a specific racial linkage.</p>
<p>But interestingly enough, because dementia is associated with getting older, the more successful countries and economies are – the better nutrition, the better hygiene, the better medical care – the longer we live.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the turn of the 1900s, the turn of that century, the 20th century, you lived into your 40s. That was old age. We’d be well gone probably by now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As societies get wealthier, people live longer. So it's not racially linked per se, but we are seeing the greatest rates of increase in the so-called developing world – so, Asia, Africa, those continents are seeing a very high increase in the rates within their population proportionately. And that’s a big challenge because they're arguably less prepared than wealthier nations to respond to that need.</p>
<h3 id="individual-variations">Individual variations</h3>
<p>It presents quite differently across individuals, and it presents differently across the course or the trajectory of the condition.</p>
<p>So later on we’ll talk about stages of dementia. Early on, it primarily presents in a cognitive or thinking way. So there may be changes in an individual’s memory. There may be changes to their ability to plan. There may be some personality or mood changes that they, and indeed their loved ones, might identify.</p>
<p>As the condition progresses, however, we certainly see physical manifestations, physical signs that we’re more used to in, say, the cancers or heart diseases that we’re more familiar with thinking of as physical conditions.</p>
<p>Because the brain is responsible for pretty much everything that goes on in the body, in the later stages of dementia, we see physical symptoms. We see immobility, we see infections, pneumonia, much broader physical signs of disease progression, along with continuing issues around thinking, perception, behaviours, reasoning, and so on. So it's a very complex and ultimately global condition that affects the person in their entirety.</p>
<h3 id="remaining-life">Remaining life</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Individual variation is important to remember, both between individuals with the one form of dementia - for example, Alzheimer’s – and across the different courses of dementia, there’s variation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On average though, it's around five years from diagnosis to death.</p>
<p>Other factors that might impact on that is when the person got their diagnosis, how long they’d had the condition before diagnosis. But it's around five years.</p>
<p><strong>There’s a large range, however, within that space.</strong></p>
<p>So, someone with Alzheimer’s may live from diagnosis to death for 20 years. Someone with a condition called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is a very fast-acting condition, may live only six months from diagnosis to death. So a large range, but an average of around five years, across everyone we’ve ever measured with dementia from diagnosis to death</p>
<h3 id="treatment">Treatment</h3>
<h4 id="pseudo-dementia">Pseudo dementia</h4>
<p>We’ll sometimes hear of people with a dementia that has turned around, but it is not the true dementias.</p>
<p>We regard those as not true dementias. They’re called <strong>pseudo dementia</strong>. So it might be something like vitamin B12 deficiency can give rise to a syndrome that looks, to all intents and purposes, like dementia.</p>
<p>But if we can identify the cause and it's a reversible pseudo dementia and we can treat the person with vitamin B12, for example, that’s reversible.</p>
<h4 id="true-dementia">True dementia</h4>
<p>But the true dementias, the dementias caused by Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, vascular disease, they are not curable. They’re <strong>not reversible</strong>.</p>
<p>In terms of treatment, however, there’s lots of things we can do to treat the person therapeutically in response to their symptoms, and we’ll talk about those at length throughout the course.</p>
<p>We’ll also talk about a couple of drug classes that some people with dementia at certain stages and with a lot of individual variation may respond to. And what those drugs – if they work for the person – will do is mask or delay the symptoms for some time. Broadly speaking, they work for about a third of people that they're going to work for, and the effects last for maybe six, nine months, 12 months.</p>
<p>For some individuals, the effect may be longer. <strong>But ultimately, because those drugs don't treat the diseases that cause dementia, the disease will overwhelm the effect of the drug, and we will see symptoms progress, so we couldn't say that that’s remotely a cure.</strong></p>
<p>Dementia’s a terminal illness. It’s an incurable condition that shortens the life expectancy of individuals with that condition.</p>
<h4 id="why-is-it-important-to-get-a-diagnosis">Why is it important to get a diagnosis?</h4>
<p>And there’s debate about this. There are varying views on this, but a very prominent view is that <u><strong>early diagnosis is worthwhile</strong>, because it gives the person the opportunity to perhaps trial some of those drugs that may delay symptom onset</u>.</p>
<p>It also helps to dispel some of the fear and anxiety that people are experiencing because of the changes that they can see perhaps in themselves or I can see in my loved one. So finding out what the cause of that might be, indeed identifying if this might be a reversible condition, one of those pseudo dementias.</p>
<p>Importantly, giving individuals the chance to talk about their health preferences, their healthcare preferences, making advanced directives, perhaps, talking to their loved ones about their values and what they’d like to see and not see in their healthcare.</p>
<p>Doing those important things relationally, that matter, saying what needs to be said, doing something that you might really want to do before you lose the capacity to do so. And importantly from a health practitioner and a health policy perspective, if we don't know the numbers of people who have dementia, then our health system can’t respond and plan for those needs. So if we’re always guessing at numbers, we can’t provide adequate home care, respite care, hospital, community care. So for both local, individual, and broader community reasons, I’d certainly argue that early diagnosis is worthwhile.</p>
<p>It is not an easy decision however, because this is not a diagnosis that people are going to welcome into their lives. But not having a diagnosis doesn't alter the course of dementia. So you're not able to escape that condition by avoiding seeking medical guidance in that respect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr Mitchell also states that, in the same way that people with end-stage terminal cancer do not benefit from invasive interventions that prolong life, neither do people in the final stages of dementia.</p>
<p>Dementia is described here as a terminal condition. What does this mean?</p>
<p>Do you think that people with dementia should be cared for as if they have a terminal condition?</p>
<ul>
<li>A terminal condition or illness is a disease that can not be cured or adequately treated and that is reasonably expected to result in the death of the person.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's important to recognise that having dementia is much more than having a memory problem</p>

<h2 id="the-nervous-system">The Nervous System</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Now that we have been introduced to the complexities of dementia, we turn to developing our understanding of the condition. The first step in this is to understand that dementia is caused by diseases affecting the brain. We begin by looking at the normal features and workings of the nervous system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Nervous System is the 'master controller' of the body, influencing everything we do.</p>
<p><img src="C:\Users\heart\Desktop\Blog\source\images\HMS\image-20210904221325124.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The nervous system is like a central organiser for the body with these nerves coming out from the spinal cord here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is made up of billions of tiny cells called <strong>neurons</strong> which work together to enable us to: sense and respond to our environment; control what is going on inside us; and perform 'higher order' functions such as thinking, planning, understanding the world and producing our inner mental experience, as well as our unique personalities and behaviours.</p>
<p>The Nervous System is organised into two main parts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The <strong>central nervous system</strong> (CNS) includes the <strong>brain</strong>, protected by the skull, and the <strong>spinal cord</strong>, which is anchored inside the vertebral column (spine).</li>
<li>The rest of the nervous system branches out from the central nervous system and is called the <strong>peripheral nervous system</strong> (PNS). The PNS is a system of nerves which are like two-way streets carrying sensory information to the CNS from the rest of the body, and information away from the CNS to control muscles, organs and glands.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="neuron">Neuron</h3>
<p><img src="C:\Users\heart\Desktop\Blog\source\images\HMS\image-20210904221142052.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neurons receive information through specialised structures called <strong>dendrites</strong>. The activity created by this information flows through the cell body and axon, then exits via the axon terminals at a specialised structure called a synapse. A synapse is where the axon of one cell and the dendrite of another cell meet. There is actually a tiny gap here, across which a specialised chemical called a <strong>neurotransmitter</strong> passes to relay the message (or information) on to the next cell. The neurotransmitter from the axon terminal binds (connects) to a specialised <strong>receptor</strong> on the dendrite, which triggers activity in that cell.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="cell">Cell</h3>
<p>The individual units of the nervous system and that the individual unit, we call it a 'cell' and there are cells of the body and our whole body is made up of cells and these are really tiny structures; hundreds and thousands of them would fit on a pin head, for example.</p>
<p>Then the cells of the nervous system, the main cell type that we're interested in, is called a neuron and it has quite a specialised structure, but there are other cell types in the nervous system, like the glia, they're supporting cells that have a whole range of very important functions.</p>
<p>But the neurons are the ones that are the communicating cells and they have quite a specialised structure, a neuron and we'll start by describing the cell body, which is the central part of a neuron and it's sort of rounded in shape often, although the shape can change depending on what kind of neuron we're looking at. And the cell body looks something like that and then the cell body contains the nucleus, which is where our DNA is, our chromosomes, or the genetic material which controls the neuron and tell that what to do; that's right, that's in the nucleus. And then what makes the cells of the nervous system, or the neurons quite particular, is they have these long branches or protrusions that come off the cell body and they have one main protrusion which is called an axon and an axon can be really long and it carries information often over vast distances throughout the body.</p>
<p><img src="C:\Users\heart\Desktop\Blog\source\images\HMS\image-20210904222016113.png" /></p>
<p>To get an idea of the scale of a neuron and what the axon looks like, I like to think of the cell body being the size of a tennis ball and then from the tennis ball you have, let's say, a garden hose that comes out from the tennis ball and it can travel about 10 kilometres, or six miles, before it gets to the end.</p>
<p>It's long and it's thin and it has a particular function the axon, and the axon carries information out of the cell body and down to wherever the axon ends.</p>
<p>So for example, if we wanted to control our muscles, that's made up of two neurons, generally one that starts right up in the top of the brain that sends its axon all the way down through the brain stem, down the spinal cord, then it makes a connection to the next neuron and then that axon might go all the way down to the muscles of the toes; so they're two very long projections.</p>
<p>Overall, in some cases just two cells - from the brain, right all the way down to toe. In other cases there are many more than that, but at a minimum, these cells are very long and the axons themselves are really long, built especially for carrying information and the information they carry is electrical information; so it's kind of like a wire circuit, a wire travelling through an electrical circuit the same way the axon travels through the body and carries electricity and that's how we can communicate really rapidly, sending messages down the axon.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-that-information-handled">How is that information handled</h3>
<p>The end of an axon, we call that an 'axon terminal', because it's the end of an axon. Axons, usually there's only one of them coming out of the neuron, sometimes they branch along the way, or they branch at the end; so you can have a number of axon terminals for each axon. But here it is, coming in to join a dendrite, which is a receiving part of a neighbouring neuron, or a neighbouring cell.</p>
<p><img src="C:\Users\heart\Desktop\Blog\source\images\HMS\image-20210904222705647.png" /></p>
<p>And it's interesting, because the electricity comes along the axon always in the same direction and then when it gets to the axon terminal, it changes from electrical activity to chemical activity. And what happens is that electricity that comes in results in a chemical that moves from one neuron to the next; and that chemical is called a 'neurotransmitter', so it's really just a communication parcel carrying the message from one cell to the next.</p>
<p><img src="C:\Users\heart\Desktop\Blog\source\images\HMS\image-20210904222753642.png" /></p>
<p>And that neurotransmitter, there is a number of different ones that the nervous system uses; there's really a collection of them. Some of the main ones that it uses, it uses all over the body and when that little parcel - it's a little vesicle, a little package of neurotransmitter leaves the axon on terminal, it gets picked up by the dendrite and then the dendrite says 'oh hello, here we are, here comes a message, here comes some chemical into my dendrite' and then that neurotransmitter gets received, comes into the dendrite and then the dendrite turns that back into electrical energy and the electrical energy comes down the dendrite towards the cell body of the next neuron.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Glutamate, s what we call an 'excitatory neurotransmitter'. That's a neurotransmitter that says 'on, yes, let's do something, here's a positive message'.And then there are other neurotransmitters that are 'turning off' neurotransmitters. One you might have heard is GABA, or Glycine. The names of them don't really matter, but those ones are inhibitory, they tell the next neuron to switch off; so that's carrying a negative message</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="how-is-all-that-connected-up">How is all that connected up?</h3>
<p>In this case, in the brain, there are hundreds of thousands of neurons all going in different directions, creating what we call 'circuits' or 'circuitry' around the brain.</p>
<h3 id="summary-points">Summary Points</h3>
<ul>
<li>The main role of the nervous system is to control the functions of the rest of the body.</li>
<li>You may be conscious or not conscious of the activities of the nervous system.</li>
<li>Nerve cells, called neurons, have a specialised structure to enable them to communicate with each other, as well as other tissues such as muscles and glands.</li>
<li>Neurons have a cell body, dendrites and usually one axon.</li>
<li>Neurons receive information through the dendrites, which leads to an electrical signal that is propagated down the axon.</li>
<li>At the ends of the branches of the axon are synapses.</li>
<li>The electrical signal that comes down the axon leads to the release of a chemical messenger, known as a neurotransmitter, at the synapse.</li>
<li>The neurotransmitter interacts with receptors on the surface of the next neuron, causing it to be excited or inhibited.</li>
<li>The cerebral cortex is the large structure that sits on top the rest of the brain, and is responsible for our most advanced 'human' functions such as thoughts, feelings and personality.</li>
<li>It is divided up into 'lobes' (e.g. frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital), that are associated with specific higher cognitive functions.</li>
<li>The hippocampus is a structure in the temporal lobe that has an important role in the formation of new memories.</li>
<li>The adult cerebral cortex has the ability to modify the connections between neurons, which we refer to as 'plasticity' of the brain.</li>
